Package for various algorithms, implemented for learning purposes.

### Algorithms
- Regression Decision Tree (CART)
- Gradient Boosting Machine
- Random Forest

#### Stanford Algorithms Part 1
- MergeSort (including CountArrayInversions)
- QuickSort
- Random Contraction (for Graphs)
- Depth First Search (including calculating Strongly Connected Components)
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- 2Sum
- Heaps and Median Maintenance

#### Stanford Algorithms Part 2
- Scheduling
- Prims Minimum Spanning Tree
- Single Link Clustering

## Tests
```bash
python -m unittest tests/[filename.py]
```

Switching to using Pytest, remains to be seen how these will play together
```
python -m pytest tests/stanford2/test_singlelinkclustering.py
```
